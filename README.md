# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This project involves refactoring the CSS and HTML of an existing code to improve it without changing its functionality and aesthetics. The main purpose of these changes is to make the website more accessible for people with disabilities and to improve its overall coding readability to meet certain standards. This includes the use of semantic elements, the simplification of website styling by removing repeated code, the use of more descriptive comments, and ensuring the logical structure and sequential order within the webpage.
